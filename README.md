This repository is from a job that I've done for the company I used to work on. The name of the company is Kuba Inteligência da Informação, and you can have more info/contact here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/kuba-intelig%C3%AAncia-da-informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o/. 

It was coded for an brewery named Bodebrown (the one that made Iron Maiden beer).

The site has the following functions:

 - A web menu for the clients in the brewery.
 - It has QrCode integration, and this QrCode is generated by the system.
 - The administrators can create products and categories.
 - The products and categories has options to select the sequence that want to show on the menu.

The menu doesn't have the function to make an order (it was a client demand), so is only for showing the menu options.

The system is in use by the brewery on the URL: https://bodebrown.kubainteligencia.com.br/ and https://bodebrown.kubainteligencia.com.br/cardapio But I don't support it anymore since I'm no longer part of the company (Kuba Inteligência) anymore. The code presented here in the repo was done by me, everything else that has been added or removed on the production site was done by the current dev team of Kuba.
